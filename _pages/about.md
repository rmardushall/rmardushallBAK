I am a student at the University of New South Wales. I am pursuing a PhD in Nuclear Engineering, with my major work being development of multiphysics simulation tools for [Gen.IV](https://www.gen-4.org) nuclear reactor designs. Specifically I am interested in pebble-bed, molten salt cooled (PB-FHR) designs, a variation on liquid fueled [molten-salt reactor (MSR)](https://www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_42150/molten-salt-reactor-msr) designs.

I am the co-founder of Ouranos Space Systems, whose role is to develop compact fission reactors for space applications. Along with my fellow Ouranos colleagues I hope to facilitate future space exploration and collinsation through the supply of abundant, consistent power.

In this website you will find a lot of different things (hopefully) that I have decided are worth putting in a public space. I will try to document my efforts with using open-source software for the purpose of multiphysics simulation, publications, personal updates, and anything else that could be interesting or helpful to others.
